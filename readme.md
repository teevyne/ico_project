# WELCOME TO THE ICO PROJECT

 A new coin is debuting on the platform and oering an ICO. The coin is available for bidding over a
particular time frame called the bidding window. This window would be arbitrarily defined by the coin master.

At the end of the bidding window an auction logic is used to decide how many tokens go to which
bidder until all available tokens have been allotted, or all the bidders have received the tokens they
bid for, whichever comes earlier.

To run this project on your system, kindly do the following:
1. Create a folder on your system or use any comfortable folder
2. 'cd' into the folder and clone this repository into it
3. Create a virtual environment with the command ``python -m venv env``
4. cd into the folders with the path ``.../env/Scripts``, type activate and press enter
5. Once, the virtual environemt is active, 'cd' out two steps using the command ``cd ../..``
6. Install the dependencies of this project into the new environment using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
7. Open project in your favourite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and run you server with the command ``python manage.py runserver``.
The default port is always 8000 but you can specify your preferred port after the ``runserver`` keyword

Project should be up and running after this.

Thank you
